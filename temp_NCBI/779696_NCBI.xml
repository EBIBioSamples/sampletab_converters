Skin samples  (&amp;amp;lt;100mg) were collected from the dorsal-anterior site of the fish, transferred to 1ml RNAlater  solution (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) and stored at 4*C for 24 h and then at -80*C until  RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the skin samples using the TRI reagent according to the  manufacturerâ€™s recommendations. The final sample used for Roche 454 sequencing was an equimolar mixture of all these samples.</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">University of Aberdeen</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="g.micallef@abdn.ac.uk">           <Name>             <First>Giulia</First>             <Last>Micallef</Last>           </Name>         </Contact>       </Contacts>     </Owner>     <Models>       <Model>Generic</Model>     </Models>     <Package>Generic</Package>     <Attributes/>     <Status status="live" when="2014-03-29T07:30:14"/>   </BioSample>                                      </BioSampleSet>
