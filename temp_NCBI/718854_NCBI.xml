The flowers were immediately put in tap water after harvest and then were transported to the laboratory within 1 h. After being cut to 25 cm under water, the flowers were placed in deionized water (DW) for further processing.  The flowers were treated with 10 ppm ethylene and 2 ppm 1-MCP in sealed airtight chamber as described previously (Ma et al., 2008). Flowers exposed to air were used as control. The treatments were conducted at 23 ~ 25 °C and 1 mol L-1 NaOH was placed in the chamber to prevent the accumulation of CO2. After treatment with certain time, the floral organs were collected respectively and were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, and then were stored in -80°C for further use. The treatment time are 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h for 454 sequencing.</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">Department of Ornamental Horticulture, China Agriculture University</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="gaojp@cau.edu.cn" phone="86-10-62733848" lab="Postharvest Physiology of Ornamental Plant">           <Name>             <First>Junping</First>             <Last>Gao</Last>           </Name>         </Contact>       </Contacts>     </Owner>     <Models>       <Model>Generic</Model>     </Models>     <Package>Generic</Package>     <Attributes/>     <Status status="live" when="2014-03-29T07:28:18"/>   </BioSample>                                      </BioSampleSet>
