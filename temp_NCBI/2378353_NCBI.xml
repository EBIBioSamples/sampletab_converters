The mosquitoes were maintained in an incubator at 27 degrees C on a 12:12 light:dark cycle.  To extract RNA from females, the reproductive tract (not including the ovaries) was dissected out from 805 virgin 4-7 day old adults.  For males, the accessory glands and seminal vesicles were dissected out from 720 virgin 1-4 day old adults. All dissections were performed on ice in 0.7% sodium chloride made with DEPC-treated water.  Tissues were placed into Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), ground with a pestle, and stored at -80 degrees.  </Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="JRIBEIRO@niaid.nih.gov">           <Name>             <First>Jose</First>             <Last>Ribeiro</Last>           </Name>         </Contact>       </Contacts>     </Owner>     <Models>       <Model version="1.0">Generic</Model>     </Models>     <Package>Generic</Package>     <Attributes>       <Attribute display_name="geographic location" harmonized_name="geo_loc_name" attribute_name="geographic location">USA: New Jersey</Attribute>       <Attribute display_name="development stage" harmonized_name="dev_stage" attribute_name="development stage">adult</Attribute>       <Attribute display_name="sex" harmonized_name="sex" attribute_name="sex">female</Attribute>       <Attribute display_name="tissue" harmonized_name="tissue" attribute_name="tissue">reproductive organs</Attribute>       <Attribute display_name="strain" harmonized_name="strain" attribute_name="strain">New Jersey</Attribute>     </Attributes>     <Links>       <Link type="entrez" target="bioproject" label="PRJNA223166">223166</Link>     </Links>     <Status status="live" when="2014-04-06T06:48:26.630"/>   </BioSample>                                      </BioSampleSet>
