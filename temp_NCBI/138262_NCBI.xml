The specimens were kept in RNAlater* (Applied Biosystems) until they were processed. In order to capture RNA viruses together with the rest of the associated microorganisms, total RNA was extracted from an individual sample composed of 100 female sandflies. These pooled samples were submitted for high-throughput pyrosequencing.</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">CREG-UNLP</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="ldiambra@gmail.com" lab="Lab.
