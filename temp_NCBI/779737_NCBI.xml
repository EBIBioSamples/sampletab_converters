Publically available segregating seed was planted in the greenhouse and plants were grown to a point where leaf tissue could be harvested. Leaf tissue was ground and extracted using solvents and rosmarinic acid levels of each plant in the population were compared to a purchased standard using a validated HPLC method. Vegetative cuttings of each greenhouse-grown plant were planted in the field for verification. Of 35 individual high rosmarinic acid plants selected from the population of &amp;amp;gt;200 plants, KI-MsEM0110 showed excellent vigorous growth which makes it an agronomically feasible crop to grow. Rhizomes of KI-MsEM0110 were used to vegetatively propagate this plant into a unique clonal line. The KI-MsEM0110 clonal line was tested under field conditions which confirmed the agronomic feasibility of this unique clonal line to produce rosmarinic acid in its leaf tissue at sufficient quantities to allow for economic extraction. KI-MsEM0110 was fully sequenced at the DNA level. Fresh leaves were grounded to fine powder using liquid nitrogen. Total gDNA was isolated using Qiagen DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen Cat# 69104)</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">Data2Bio</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="support@data2bio.com">           <Name>             <First>Data2Bio</First>             <Last>www.data2bio.com</Last>           </Name>         </Contact>       </Contacts>     </Owner>     <Models>       <Model>Generic</Model>     </Models>     <Package>Generic</Package>     <Attributes/>     <Status status="live" when="2014-03-29T07:30:15"/>   </BioSample>                                      </BioSampleSet>
