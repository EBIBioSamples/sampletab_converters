Embryos are placed in  S-basal buffer and incubated at 25 deg over night to hatch the L1s. We then  put the hatched L1s on a seeded NGM plate at 25 deg for 30 hours. At 30 hours,  the resulting worms are in the L4 stage, and all are males because the  hermpahrodites die due to a failure to initiate dosage compensation, as  confirmed by examination under the dissecting microscope.  This sample is available through the modENCODE DCC (www.modencode.org) as: L4MALE6cap2  The original N2 larva L4 library is available as DCC project: Male larva mid-L4 25dC 30 hrs post-L1  Local library name: L4MALE6cap2  Quality values are ASCII encoded Phred + 33.    Flowcell 428A0AAXX was processed with GAPipeline 1.4 and is 36bp. Flowcell 61BDCAAXX was processed with GAPipeline 1.8 and is 76bp.   </Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="UWGS-RW">University of Washington Genome Sciences</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact lab="Robert Waterston"/>       </Contacts>     </Owner>     <Models>       <Model>Generic</Model>     </Models>     <Package>Generic</Package>     <Attributes/>     <Links>       <Link type="db_xref" target="pubmed">19181841</Link>     </Links>     <Status status="live" when="2014-03-28T16:07:49"/>   </BioSample>                                      </BioSampleSet>
