The sample was collected using sterile swabs (30 cm2 surface area per swab) wetted with sterile dH2O.  Ten swabs were collected per sample and immersed in 6 mL sterile dH2O. The samples were placed on ice and processed within 24 hours.The 6 mL dH2O swab samples were sonicated for 20 sec, vortexed for 1 min and sonicated again for 20 sec after which the swabs were aseptically removed.  The remaining sample was pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 18,000 x g, the supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 567 ÂµL TE buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8). The sample was subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen and boiling water, followed by a single 15 min boiling cycle for cell lysis.  DNA was extracted using a modification of the Genomic Extraction of DNA from bacteria described by Ausuble et al. 1995.</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">University of Arizona</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="moo@email.arizona.edu" lab="Raina M.
