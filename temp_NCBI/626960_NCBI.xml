Briefly, the sample was taken 20 cm below the surface in order to obtain a sample minimally impacted by Aeolian dispersion and therefore secure the sampling of permanent microbial populations. The area selected was as far as possible from plants to avoid rhizosphere effects.  About a 100 g of soil were sampled and stored in sterile polycarbonate tubes at 4*C and processed within 24 hours. The soil was then dried and sieved with a sterile 2mm sieve. Total genomic DNA from dry soil was extracted using Fast DNA spin kit for soils (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA).</Paragraph>       </Comment>     </Description>     <Owner>       <Name abbreviation="">University of Arizona</Name>       <Contacts>         <Contact email="moo@email.arizona.edu" lab="Raina M.
